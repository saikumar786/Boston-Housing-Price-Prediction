# Boston-Housing-Price-Prediction
Boston House Price Prediction by taking the default dataset available in sklearn dataset

I have used the default boston-dataset from sklearn.datasets to predict the price of houses in Boston

I have created a DataFrame of this data, as it is not in a proper format in sklearn.datasets

And then I assigned column names, target variable to the DataFrame

It is a Regression Problem. So I have used Linear Regression in solving this
